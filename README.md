# Todo list with useReducer

I've found useReducer to be a particularly difficult concept to get my head around, so here's a practice app I did. This was heavily influenced by web dev simplified's useReducer [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK_Wqx3RnHk), but I broke it up into different components, files, and also added react-bootstrap for basic styling.
